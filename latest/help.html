<h3>What is Matisse</h3>

<p>Matisse is a collaborative whiteboard. Create a whiteboard or open your existing one, send the url to your friend and then work on it together. All your changes are visible to them and their changes to you.</p>

<h3>Key shortcuts</h3>

<p> 
  <ul>
    <li>"Alt + Delete"  for deleting a shape</li>
    <li>"Shift + Arrow"  for big moves of the selected shape</li>
    <li>"Arrow"  for finer moves of the selected shape</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>How to change the properties</h3>

<p>Select any element on the canvas, a small toolbox would appear on top of it. Click the gear icon, it would open the properties box. </p>


<h3>What does save do</h3>

<p>Save opens the contents of the canvas as a new image. Save the image locally using "save image as" from the browser context menu.</p>

<h3>Future Direction</h3>

<p>Send people to moon, ok, not that, add more widgets, support images from external sources, clone a sites major visual style and much more. Look at the issues under backlog on our github page.</p>
